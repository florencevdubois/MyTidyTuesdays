# This  week, I plotted a map of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island's federal electoral ridings.
# I then merged tidytuesday's featured dataset to plot the position of wind turbines on the map.
# And to get things even more interesting, I also included Mildenberger et al.'s data, created from a survey of 
# Canadians on the topic of climate change. Here's the source: 
# Mildenberger, M., Howe, P.D., Lachapelle, E., Stokes, L.C., Marlon, J., and Gravelle, T. 
# “The distribution of climate change public opinion in Canada.” PLoS ONE 11(8) eo159774. 
# The data is available here on the University of Montreal website: https://www.umontreal.ca/climat/index.html
# There are a few opinion questions in the Mildenberger's data, including questions on the consequences of climate
# change and on policies to tackle climate change.

# you can also use the mapcan package to plot the Canada map
# like this 
# provinces = mapcan(boundaries = ridings, 
#                    type = standard) 

# but I could not get the coordinates from the df to match the format of the coordinates in the wind turbines df
# that's why I used raw shapefiles instead and converted the boundaries using this line of code:
# spTransform(boundaries,"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0")
