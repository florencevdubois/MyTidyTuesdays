# My Tidy Tuesdays

This repository contains all of my contributions to R4DS's Tidy Tuesdays. Tidy Tuesday is a weekly data visualization challenge aimed at developing "R skills, get feedback, explore otherâ€™s work, and connect with the greater #RStats community." More information here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday.

I do not participate weekly, but Tidy Tuesdays have taught me a lot in terms of data wrangling and visualization! You can find my graphs in the __graph__ folder, and my code files in the __code__ folder.
